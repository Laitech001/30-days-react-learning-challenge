## CGPA Calculator Project.

I successfully build a CGPA Calculator project with react, and deploy it so people can start using it.

## what I learn when building the project

the project makes me understand React:
1. component
2. props
3. useState
4. useEffect
5. onChange Effect
6. How css and jsx file connected and work with each other
7. and I learn how to deploy both manually (npm run build) and automatically from github to netlify.

## To the next step
