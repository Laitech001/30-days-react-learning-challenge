## Day 6: Learning useEffect + Life lesson (BIG WIN)

## useEffect in React
useEffect is like onload effect in javascript, it is a React Hook that let a component react to changes or perform side effects.
it's also a way to run code automatically when something happens in my component.

## How to use it
useEffect(() => {
  // code to run will be written here.
});
the code above is useEffect basic code.

## using useEffect with dependency 
useEffect can come with second arguements at times which is dependency array.
useEffect(() => {
  // code to run
}, [dependency]);
[dependency] = tells React when to run the effect
If the array is empty [], effect runs only once when the component mounts.

## When to use useEffect
Use useEffect anytime your component needs to do something outside of just rendering.

## The logic behind useEffect
  1. React renders your UI
  2. React checks if the dependencies for useEffect changed
  3. If yes → React runs the effect function
  4. If there’s a cleanup function → React runs it first before re-running the effect
  5. This keeps side effects predictable and synced with state.

## Analogy 
useSate: this remember and display stuff
useEffect: this do something when the stuff changes, or when component appear or disappear.
