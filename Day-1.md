## Day 1 of learning React
Day 1: Introduction to react

1. I understand what how powerful react is, what is use for and why it’s important in programming especial when dealing with frontend.
2. I learn how to set up react on window, it’s not easy as I think but I am able to do it, not just by watching a tutorial video but by going to chatgpt to know it and searching through web.

## Achievement.
I finally install node.js on my window and make the react app run in my browser.

Next step in react should be: JSX and Component.
